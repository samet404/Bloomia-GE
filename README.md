Bloomia game engine is not actually a game engine, rather it's built on top of the popular easy-to-use game engine called "raylib". The main purpose of Bloomia engine is improving 3D game development in raylib by adding much more 3D capabilities such as easy light source control, map design tools, shadow and shader functionalities.

The engine will be shaped around another project called Bloomia (https://bloomia.app) while keeping the core game engine itself separate.
